Welcome!

This is the web site of a group of Thoracic Radiologists who work in various academic radiology programs in the U.S. We conduct a web-based video conference—[the Society of Thoracic Radiology (STR) webinar](http://thoracicrad.org/?page_id=312)— each week at which we present (anonymized) interesting cases and share them afterwards with other members of the group in the form of DICOM data sets. For those that cannot attend the webinar, a video of each is subsequently made available at the [STR YouTube channel] [2].

We use [OsiriX] [1] for this purpose. Three members of our group presently host personal online OsiriX-based Teaching File Servers permitting authorized physicians to view and download cases over the Internet:

This site provides guidance documents for those interested in learning how to use OsiriX for educational purposes, sharing cases and establishing Teaching File Servers. I will add guides sporadically to this site. Add the site RSS feed to your [RSS reader] [7] and you'll be notified when new guides are published.

Sincerely,

Howard Mann, M.D.
