Update: February 24, 2016. The site is now powered by [Hugo] (http://gohugo.io).

This repository contains relevant source (folder) and other files for the [Chest Radiologists Collaborative](http://chestradiologists.org) web site.

It is built with [Octopress 2.0] (http://octopress.org).

View a screenshot of the site's main page (CRCWebsite.jpg) above.

(The proper designation for the configuration YML file in Octopress is "_config.yml")

The site's theme is a minor modification of the Octopress default theme at the time I used it. If you like it, help yourself to the layout - and style-relevant files.
